State Mgt
----------

Why State Mgt?
Web Application use http/https protocol to work with.

So these both are stateLess(donot maintain the state of a object/page)
across the request/response cycle.

page state(at a particular moment of time whatever are the values on the page) 
is availble only a single request.

So if we want to remember/maintain the state of the page then we need to
use some techniques.


State Management
-----------------
1) Client Side State Mgt----they are stored on the browser by the server.
ViewState,Cookies,Hidden Fields,Query String

ViewState-----Key/values 
is used to accept data and show it immediately on the same page.


Cookies--- are text files,  but very risky to store sensitive data.
uses key value pairs/Name value collection
they are used to transfer data from one page to another.

QueryString: used to transfer data from one page to another.
it uses a string along with "?" so called Query String.


2) Server Side State Mgt----they are stored on the server by the server.
Session,Application
